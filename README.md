# Differential Diagnosis of Asthma and COPD using two or more than two dataset from ICbhI , KAUH , AIIMS Raipur.

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of differentiating between asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The above datasets provides a comprehensive collection of respiratory sound recordings , facilitating advanced research in respiratory diagnostics.

## Background

Asthma and COPD are prevalent chronic respiratory diseases that significantly impact global health. Accurate differentiation between these conditions is crucial for effective treatment and management. Traditional diagnostic methods often face challenges due to overlapping symptoms, making the development of automated, data-driven approaches highly valuable.

## Dataset Used in this project: 

## 1. ICBHI Respiratory Sound Database

The **ICBHI Respiratory Sound Database** was introduced for the International Conference on Biomedical Health Informatics (ICBHI) 2017 Challenge. It includes:

- **920** annotated audio samples from **126 subjects**
- Over **6,898** respiratory cycles
- Annotations for **crackles, wheezes, both, or none**
- Recordings collected using multiple devices
- Duration ranges between **10 to 90 seconds**

## 2. KAUH Respiratory Sound Dataset

The **KAUH Respiratory Sound Dataset** originates from King Abdullah University Hospital and includes:

- **337** respiratory sound recordings from **112 subjects**
- Duration between **5 to 30 seconds**
- Covers multiple respiratory conditions such as:
  - **Asthma**
  - **Pneumonia**
  - **Heart Failure**
  - **Bronchiectasis**
  - **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**
  - **Healthy subjects (control group)**
